# HyViewerWeb-Clone

This is a clone for my private project. 

# IDEA
The idea is to create a website UI that a person can use to get data from the HyPixel API, things like the Bazaar items and the average price of a tool in the AH (auction house).

# DESIGN
This mainly uses java to create everything, nothing in the HTML, CSS, and JS has been coded by me, only the java classes. Framwork is Vaadin v24, which is great to create beautiful websites purely using Java.
Using html and css to desgin the website UI is actually better and can be done directly with Vaadin, but Vaadin desgins were good enough for me, maybe for future improvements.


# TODO

- Better display of auction data
- lots of code cleanup
